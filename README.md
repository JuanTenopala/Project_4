# Project 4


## Topic
Summer Olympics Medals 


## Objective
This project aims to create a prediction of medals dashboard per country, based on an ML model and on previous Olympic Games performance data. The dataset to fit such model was found and is available in Kaggle page [Summer Olympics Medals (1976-2008)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/summer-olympics-medals). 

Potential uses of this model are: 
* as a base for sport bets sites predictions
* as a benchmark for team's performance 
* among others


## Inspiration
Olympic Games represent some of the best characteristics of human condition and precisely 2024 is a Summer Olympic Games year, then predicting a medals dashboard is a natural choice. 


## Visuals
One or more of the following: 
- A map  
- A bar chart displaying the number of medals per country 
- A bubble chart displaying the quantity of medals per discipline 


## Project components 
One or more of the following: 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn 
- SQL (PostgreSQL) 
- Tableau 


## Ethical considerations
The dataset employed was found in open data in Kaggle site; it was reviewed the T&C and compliance was ensured. 

In the dataset, it was identified no bias related to people. 

About Personal Data Protection, the dataset contains only personal information that is publicly available about the competitors (name, country, medals earned, etc.). Therefore no special treatment of Personal Data was deemed necessary.

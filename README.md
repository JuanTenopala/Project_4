# Project 4


## Topic
Summer Olympics Medals 


## Objective
This project aims to create a dashboard containing a prediction of medals, based on an ML model and on previous Olympic Games performance data. The dataset to fit such model was found and is available in Kaggle page [Summer Olympics Medals (1976-2008)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/summer-olympics-medals). 

Potential uses of this model are: 
* as a base for sport bets sites predictions
* as a benchmark for teams' performance 
* as an reference for general public, etc


## Inspiration
Olympic Games represent some of the best characteristics of human condition and precisely 2024 is a Summer Olympic Games year, then creating a dashboard to predict medal count was a natural choice. 


## Visuals
One or more of the following: 
- A bubble chart displaying the quantity of medals 
- A table displaying the results of the ML model 


## Project components 
One or more of the following: 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn 
- SQL (PostgreSQL) 
- Tableau 


## Ethical considerations
**Dataset source**: The dataset employed was found in open data in Kaggle site; it was reviewed the T&C and compliance was ensured. 

**Dataset bias**: it was identified no bias related to people. 

**Personal data protection**: the dataset contains only personal information that is publicly available about the competitors (name, country, medals earned, etc.). Therefore no special treatment of Personal Data was deemed necessary.
